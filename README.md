# Overview

Anything Slider plugin comes with 2 modules:

1. Anything Slider Module
2. AS Menu Module

Slider module as the name suggests is the module which you will use to create your sliders, content sections, etc.

And the Menu module is creatively developed external menu control for sliders. You will be able to create the custom menu, tabs, filters using this menu and can link each menu item to a specific slide.

**New \(v1.2\):**This update includes a built-in Nave Menu control, which will create the menu automatically by just enabling the control within your Slider module General Tab. This control is much better to use in most of the use cases however the separate AS Menu module may come handy in some advanced use cases.

# Anything Slider Module

This is the main module. Using this module you will create your sliders, filterable, carousels, tabs, anything creative.

Letâ€™s review the options it has.

## Content Options

Following option you will find under the Content Tab.

#### Add Slides

First thing you will need to do is adding your slides to the slider, slides are your saved divi layouts. First you will need to create those slides simply as you create a divi section and then save those sections in the divi layout library. Then when you add the slider module and edit it you will be able to pick those saved slide layouts from the slide picker control here.
